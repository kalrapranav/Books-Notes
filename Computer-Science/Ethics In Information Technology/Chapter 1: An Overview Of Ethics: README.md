# Ethics in Information Technology

## The Difference between Morals, Ethics, and Laws
### Laws :
* law is a system of rules that tells us what we can and cannot do. 
* Laws are enforced by a set of institutions (the police, courts, law-making bodies)
* Violation of laws can lead to fine
* They are not static 
* Laws raise important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice, but do not provide a complete guide to ethical behavior.
* Just because an activity is defined as legal does not mean that it is ethical

### Code of Ethics
* A code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity.
* A code of ethics also referred to as an "ethical code," may encompass areas such as business ethics, a code of professional practice and an employee code of conduct.

## Ethics in Buisness World
* Ethics has risen to the top of teh buisness agenda because the risks associated with inappropriate behavious have increased. 
* It can be witnessed by the collapse and/or bailout of multiple financial institutions such as, Bank of America, CitiGroup, Countrywide Financial, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and American International Group (AIG) due to unetheicla behaviour.
* Many senior position holder have also been subjected to inprisionment due to unethical behaviour in the organisation [*](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/21/us/salmonella-peanut-exec-sentenced)
### Several Trends that has increased the likelihood of unethical behavious are: 
1. or many organizations, greater globalization has created a much more complex work environment that spans diverse cultures and societies, making it more difficult to apply principles and codes of ethics consistently.
    * Shifting operations to thirdworld contries for lower-cost by harsh work enviornment and low wages. [Case Study](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/09/01/as-apples-profits-decline-iphone-factory-workers-suffer-a-new-report-claims/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.1765249560c2)
2. In today’s challenging and uncertain economic climate, many organizations are finding it more difficult to maintain revenue and profits. Some organizations are sorely tempted to resort to unethical behavior to maintain profits.
    * Overstaing revenue/profits/sales to keep the investors [Case Study 1](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/23/tesco-profits-black-hole-bigger), [Case Study 2](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15346730/streaks-over-fiat-chrysler-admits-to-overstating-u-s-sales-reports/)
#### Here are just a few examples of lapses in business ethics by employees in IT organizations:
1. Volkswagen has admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. The company is now contending with the fallout.
2. Toshiba, the Japanese industrial giant whose diversified products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems, disclosed that it overstated its earnings over a seven-year period by more than $1.2 billion.
3. Amazon has the second highest employee turnover rate of companies in the Fortune 500 and has been criticized by some for creating a high pressure work environment in which bosses’ expectations were almost impossible to satisfy and jobs were threatened if illness or other personal issues encroached on work. 
#### Bathsheba Syndrome: 
The moral corruption of people in power, which is often facilitated by a tendency for people to look the other way when their leaders act inappropriately.

* Even lower-level employees and ordinary individuals can find themselves in the middle of ethical dilemmas such as Edward Snowden and Mark Lillie

## Corprate Social Responsibility
It is the concept that an organisation should act ethically by taking responsibility for teh imapct of its actions on its shareholders, consumers, employees, community, enviornment and suppliers. 

An organization’s approach to CSR can encompass a wide variety of tactics—from donating a portion of net profit to charity to implementing more sustainable business operations or encouraging employee education through tuition reimbursement. 

Setting CSR goals encourages an organization to achieve higher moral and ethical standards.

## Supply chain sustainability
It is a component of CSR that focuses on developing and maintaining a supply chain that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. 

Supply chain sustainability takes into account issues such as fair labor practices, energy and resource conservation, human rights, and community responsibility.

In many cases, meeting supply chain sustainability goals can also lead to lower costs. E.g. in the case of [Dell](http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/corporate/corp-comm/en/Documents/fy15-cr-report.pdf)

However, if striving to meet a specific CSR goal leads to a decrease in profits, senior management may be challenged to modify or drop that CSR goal entirely.

## Why Fostering Corporate Social Responsibility and Good Business Ethics Is Important?
Organizations have at least five good reasons to pursue CSR goals and to promote a work environment in which employees are encouraged to act ethically when making business decisions:
* Gaining the goodwill of the community
* Creating an organisation that operates consistently
* Fostering good business practices
* Protecting the organisation and its employees from legal action
* Avoiding unfavorable publicity

## Gaining the Goodwill of the community
Although organizations exist primarily to earn profits or provide services to customers, they also have some fundamental responsibilities to society. 

Philanthropy is one way in which an organization can demonstrate its values in action and make a positive connection with its stakeholders.

The goodwill that CSR activities generate can make it easier for corporations to conduct their business. 

For example, a company known for treating its employees well will find it easier to compete for the top job candidates. On the other hand, businesses that are not socially responsible run the risk of alienating their customer base. 

## Creating an Organisation That Operates Consistently
Organizations develop and abide by values to create an organizational culture and to define a consistent approach for dealing with the needs of their stakeholders—shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the community. 

Such a consistency ensures that employees know what is expected of them and can employ the organization’s values to help them in their decision making. Consistency also means that shareholders, customers, suppliers, and the community know what they can expect of the organization

#### Although each company’s value system is different, many share the following values:
* Operate with honesty and integrity, staying true to organizational principles
* Operate according to standards of ethical conduct, in words and action
* Treat colleagues, customers, and consumers with respect
* Strive to be the best at what matters most to the organization
* Value diversity
* Make decisions based on facts and principles
