# Cyberattacks and Cybersecurity

## The Threat Landscape

Business managers, IT professionals, and IT users all face a number of complex trade-offs when making decisions regarding IT security, such as the following:
* How much effort and money should be spent to safeguard against computer crime? (In other words, how safe is safe enough?)
* What should be done if recommended computer security safeguards make conducting business more difficult for customers and employees, resulting in lost sales and increased costs?
* If a firm is a victim of a cybercrime, should it pursue prosecution of the criminals at all costs, maintain a low profile to avoid the negative publicity, inform affected customers, or take some other action?

And a recent survey of more than 10,000 IT professionals around the world revealed the following:
* 58 percent of global companies have an overall security strategy
* 54 percent have a chief information security officer (CISO) in charge of security
* 53 percent have employee security awareness and training programs
* 52 percent have security standards for third parties
* 49 percent conduct threat assessments
* 48 percent actively monitor and analyze security intelligence

In spite of all these countermeasures, however, the number of computer security incidents surged from 2014 to 2015 in the following industries: public sector organizations; entertainment, media, and communications; technology and telecommunications companies; pharmaceuticals and life sciences; and power and utilities organizations.

## Why Computer Incidents Are So Prevalent

Increasing computing complexity, expanding and changing systems, an increase in the prevalence of bring your own device (BYOD) policies, a growing reliance on software with known vulnerabilities, and the increasing sophistication of those who would do harm have caused a dramatic increase in the number, variety, and severity of security incidents.

### Increasing Complexity Increases Vulnerability
Due to increase in complexity in the envioenment, the number of entries to a network expand. Thus, increasing vulnerability to a connection. 

### Expanding and Changing Systems Introduce New Risks
Due to the rapid change in the systems it is increasingly difficult for IT organizations to keep up with the pace of technological change, successfully perform an ongoing assessment of new security risks, and implement approaches for dealing with them.

### Increasing Prevalence of BYOD Policies
**bring your own device (BOYD)** is a business policy that permits, and in some cases encourages, employees to use their own mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, or laptops) to access company computing resources and applications, including email, corporate databases, the corporate intranet, and the Internet. 

As, employees devices an also be used for non-work purposes, exposing the device and the network to multiple malware. 

### Growing Reliance on Commercial Software with Known Vulnerabilities  
**Exploit:** is an attack on an information system that takes advantage of a particular system vulnerability. Often this attack is due to poor system design or implementation.

Once the vulnerability is discovered, software developers create and issue a “fix,” or patch, to eliminate the problem. Users of the system or application are responsible for obtaining and installing the patch, which they can usually download from the web.

Any delay in installing a patch exposes the user to a potential security breach. The need to install a fix to prevent a hacker from taking advantage of a known system vulnerability can create a time-management dilemma for system support personnel trying to balance a busy work schedule.
