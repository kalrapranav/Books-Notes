# Cyberattacks and Cybersecurity

## The Threat Landscape

Business managers, IT professionals, and IT users all face a number of complex trade-offs when making decisions regarding IT security, such as the following:
* How much effort and money should be spent to safeguard against computer crime? (In other words, how safe is safe enough?)
* What should be done if recommended computer security safeguards make conducting business more difficult for customers and employees, resulting in lost sales and increased costs?
* If a firm is a victim of a cybercrime, should it pursue prosecution of the criminals at all costs, maintain a low profile to avoid the negative publicity, inform affected customers, or take some other action?

And a recent survey of more than 10,000 IT professionals around the world revealed the following:
* 58 percent of global companies have an overall security strategy
* 54 percent have a chief information security officer (CISO) in charge of security
* 53 percent have employee security awareness and training programs
* 52 percent have security standards for third parties
* 49 percent conduct threat assessments
* 48 percent actively monitor and analyze security intelligence

In spite of all these countermeasures, however, the number of computer security incidents surged from 2014 to 2015 in the following industries: public sector organizations; entertainment, media, and communications; technology and telecommunications companies; pharmaceuticals and life sciences; and power and utilities organizations.

## Why Computer Incidents Are So Prevalent

Increasing computing complexity, expanding and changing systems, an increase in the prevalence of bring your own device (BYOD) policies, a growing reliance on software with known vulnerabilities, and the increasing sophistication of those who would do harm have caused a dramatic increase in the number, variety, and severity of security incidents.

### Increasing Complexity Increases Vulnerability
Due to increase in complexity in the envioenment, the number of entries to a network expand. Thus, increasing vulnerability to a connection. 

### Expanding and Changing Systems Introduce New Risks
Due to the rapid change in the systems it is increasingly difficult for IT organizations to keep up with the pace of technological change, successfully perform an ongoing assessment of new security risks, and implement approaches for dealing with them.

### Increasing Prevalence of BYOD Policies
**bring your own device (BOYD)** is a business policy that permits, and in some cases encourages, employees to use their own mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, or laptops) to access company computing resources and applications, including email, corporate databases, the corporate intranet, and the Internet. 

As, employees devices an also be used for non-work purposes, exposing the device and the network to multiple malware. 

### Growing Reliance on Commercial Software with Known Vulnerabilities  
**Exploit:** is an attack on an information system that takes advantage of a particular system vulnerability. Often this attack is due to poor system design or implementation.

Once the vulnerability is discovered, software developers create and issue a “fix,” or patch, to eliminate the problem. Users of the system or application are responsible for obtaining and installing the patch, which they can usually download from the web.

Any delay in installing a patch exposes the user to a potential security breach. The need to install a fix to prevent a hacker from taking advantage of a known system vulnerability can create a time-management dilemma for system support personnel trying to balance a busy work schedule.

### Increasing Sophistication of Those Who Would Do Harm
Today’s computer menace is much better organized and may be part of an organized group (for example, Anonymous, Chaos Computer Club, Lizard Squad, TeslaTeam, and hacker teams sponsored by national governments) that has an agenda and targets specific organizations and websites. 

Some of these groups have ample resources, including money and sophisticated tools to support their efforts. 

Today’s computer attacker has greater depth of knowledge and expertise in getting around computer and network security safeguards.

## Type of Exploits 

### Ransomware
It malware that stops you from using your computer or accessing your data until you meet certain demands, such as paying a ransom or sending photos to the attacker. 

A computer becomes infected with ransomware when a user opens an email attachment containing the malware or is lured to a compromised website by a deceptive email or pop-up window. Ransomware can also be spread through removable USB drives or by texting applications such as Yahoo Messenger, with the payload disguised as an image.

### Viruses
It a piece of programming code, usually disguised as something else, that causes a computer to behave in an unexpected and usually undesirable manner. 

For example, a virus may be programmed to display a certain message on an infected computer’s display screen, delete or modify a certain document, or reformat the hard drive.

**Macro viruses** have become a common and easily created form of virus. Attackers use an application macro language (such as Visual Basic or VBScript) to create programs that infect documents and templates. 

After an infected document is opened, the virus is executed and infects the user’s application templates.

### Worms
It is a harmful program that resides in the active memory of the computer and duplicates itself.

Worms differ from viruses in that they can propagate without human intervention, often sending copies of themselves to other computers by email.

A worm is capable of replicating itself on your computer so that it can potentially send out thousands of copies of itself to everyone in your email address book

### Trojan Horses
A Trojan horse is a seemingly harmless program in which malicious code is hidden.

A victim on the receiving end of a Trojan horse is usually tricked into opening it because it appears to be useful software from a legitimate source, such as an update for software the user currently has installed on his or her computer. 

A Trojan horse often creates a “backdoor” on a computer that enables an attacker to gain future access to the system and compromise confidential or private information.

Another type of Trojan horse is a **logic bomb**, which executes when it is triggered by a specific event. For example, logic bombs can be triggered by a change in a particular file, by typing a specific series of keystrokes, or at a specific time or date.


### Blended Threat
A blended threat is a sophisticated threat that combines the features of a virus, worm, Trojan horse, and other malicious code into a single payload. 

A blended threat attack might use server and Internet vulnerabilities to initiate and then transmit and spread an attack on an organization’s computing devices, using multiple modes to transport itself, including email, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and file-sharing networks. 

Rather than launching a narrowly focused attack on specific EXE files, a blended threat might attack multiple EXE files, HTML files, and registry keys simultaneously.

### Spam
Email spam is the use of email systems to send unsolicited email to large numbers of people. 

Most spam is a form of low-cost commercial advertising, sometimes for questionable products such as pornography, phony get-rich-quick schemes, and worthless stock.

 #### Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act 
 It is legal to spam, provided the messages meet a few basic requirements: 
* Spammers cannot disguise their identity by using a false return address
* The email must include a label specifying that it is an ad or a solicitation
* The email must include a way for recipients to indicate that they do not want future mass mailings.

Despite CAN-SPAM and other measures, the percentage of spam in email messages averaged 57 percent in one week in January, 2015, according to Trustwave, an organization that helps businesses protect data and reduce security risk.

A **partial solution** to this problem is the use of CAPTCHA to ensure that only humans obtain free accounts. 

**CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart)** software generates and grades tests that humans can pass and all but the most sophisticated computer programs cannot.

### DDoS Attacks
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one in which a malicious hacker takes over computers via the Internet and causes them to flood a target site with demands for data and other small tasks. 

A DDoS attack does not involve infiltration of the targeted system. Instead, it keeps the target so busy responding to a stream of automated requests that legitimate users cannot get in.

The term **botnet** is used to describe a large group of such computers, which are controlled from one or more remote locations by hackers, without the knowledge or consent of their owners.

Based on a command by the attacker or at a preset time, the botnet computers **(called zombie)** go into action, each sending a simple request for access to the target site again and again—dozens of times per second. 

The target computers become so overwhelmed by requests for service that legitimate users are unable to get through to the target computer.

### Rootkit
A rootkit is a set of programs that enables its user to gain administrator-level access to a computer without the end user’s consent or knowledge. Once installed, the attacker can gain full control of the system and even obscure the presence of the rootkit from legitimate system administrators.

Attackers can use the rootkit to execute files, access logs, monitor user activity, and change the computer’s configuration.

### Advanced Persistent Threat
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an intruder gains access to a network and stays there—undetected—with the intention of stealing data over a long period of time (weeks or even months). 

Attackers in an APT must continuously rewrite code and employ sophisticated evasion techniques to avoid discovery. 

APT attacks target organizations with high-value information, such as banks and financial institutions, government agencies, and insurance companies with the goal of stealing data rather than disrupting services. 

### Phishing
phishing is the act of fraudulently using email to try to get the recipient to reveal personal data. 

In a phishing scam, con artists send legitimate-looking emails urging the recipient to take action to avoid a negative consequence or to receive a reward. 

The requested action may involve clicking on a link to a website or opening an email attachment.

**Spear phishing** is a variation of phishing in which the phisher sends fraudulent emails to a certain organization’s employees. 

It is known as spear phishing because the attack is much more precise and narrow, like the tip of a spear. The phony emails are designed to look like they came from high-level executives within the organization. Employees are directed to a fake website and then asked to enter personal information, such as name, Social Security number, and network passwords. 

### Smishing and Vishing
Smishing is another variation of phishing that involves the use of texting.

In a smishing scam, people receive a legitimate-looking text message telling them to call a specific phone number or log on to a website. 

This is often done under the guise that there is a problem with the recipient’s bank account or credit card that requires immediate attention. However, the phone number or website is phony and is used to trick unsuspecting victims into providing personal information such as a bank account number, personal identification number, or credit card number, which can then be used to steal money from victims’ bank accounts, charge purchases on their credit cards, or open new accounts. 

**vishing** is similar to smishing except that the victims receive a voice-mail message telling them to call a phone number or access a website

### Cyberespionage
cyberespionage involves the deployment of malware that secretly steals data in the computer systems of organizations, such as government agencies, military contractors, political organizations, and manufacturing firms. 

The type of data most frequently targeted includes data that can provide an unfair competitive advantage to the perpetrator.

### Cyberterrorism
cyberterrorism is the intimidation of government or civilian population by using information technology to disable critical national infrastructure
