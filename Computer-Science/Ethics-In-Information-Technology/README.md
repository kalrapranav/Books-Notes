# Ethics in Information Technology

## The Difference between Morals, Ethics, and Laws
### Laws :
* law is a system of rules that tells us what we can and cannot do. 
* Laws are enforced by a set of institutions (the police, courts, law-making bodies)
* Violation of laws can lead to fine
* They are not static 
* Laws raise important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice, but do not provide a complete guide to ethical behavior.
* Just because an activity is defined as legal does not mean that it is ethical

### Code of Ethics
* A code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity.
* A code of ethics also referred to as an "ethical code," may encompass areas such as business ethics, a code of professional practice and an employee code of conduct.
