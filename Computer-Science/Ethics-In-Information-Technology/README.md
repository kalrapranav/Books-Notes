# Ethics in Information Technology

## The Difference between Morals, Ethics, and Laws
### Laws :
* law is a system of rules that tells us what we can and cannot do. 
* Laws are enforced by a set of institutions (the police, courts, law-making bodies)
* Violation of laws can lead to fine
* They are not static 
* Laws raise important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice, but do not provide a complete guide to ethical behavior.
* Just because an activity is defined as legal does not mean that it is ethical

### Code of Ethics
* A code of ethics is a guide of principles designed to help professionals conduct business honestly and with integrity.
* A code of ethics also referred to as an "ethical code," may encompass areas such as business ethics, a code of professional practice and an employee code of conduct.

2. Toshiba, the Japanese industrial giant whose diversified products and services include information technology and communications equipment and systems, disclosed that it overstated its earnings over a seven-year period by more than $1.2 billion.
3. Amazon has the second highest employee turnover rate of companies in the Fortune 500 and has been criticized by some for creating a high pressure work environment in which bosses’ expectations were almost impossible to satisfy and jobs were threatened if illness or other personal issues encroached on work. 
#### Bathsheba Syndrome: 
The moral corruption of people in power, which is often facilitated by a tendency for people to look the other way when their leaders act inappropriately.

* Even lower-level employees and ordinary individuals can find themselves in the middle of ethical dilemmas such as Edward Snowden and Mark Lillie
